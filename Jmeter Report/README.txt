Script: 
I used a basic script using python to read all of the data for each test. There is a jmeterTest.txt file in
the WebContents folder where all of the time results for both JDBC and Servlet are recorded. 
I took all of those results and put them into a jmeterTest.txt file on my desktop and ran the script to 
calculate the averages of both times and write them into a "results.txt" file on my desktop. 
I manually arranged and labelled each test result so I can correctly input them into the html report file.

Jmeter Report: 
The html report is located inside of the "Jmeter Report" folder. All of the images that the html file uses are within 
the "images" folder in that same directory.
